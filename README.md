# Delete Branch Caches

A GitHub Action to delete all caches associated with a specific branch reference in your repository.

## Features

-   Deletes all GitHub Actions caches for a given branch (`ref`)
-   Useful for cleaning up storage and avoiding stale caches

## Usage

Add the following step to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Delete branch caches
  uses: Friedinger/DeleteBranchCaches@v1
  with:
      github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      ref: ${{ github.ref }}
```

**Note:** Your workflow or job must include the following permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
    actions: write
```

This is required to allow the action to delete caches.
